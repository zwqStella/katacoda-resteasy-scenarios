Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS) is a Java programming language API specification that provides support in creating web services according to the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural pattern. By using a stateless protocol and standard operations, REST systems aim for fast performance, reliability, platform-independence and the ability to grow, by re-using components that can be managed and updated without affecting the system as a whole, even while it is running.


Resteasy is a fully certified and portable implementation of JAX-RS, which has a rich set of useful components and can be installed in multiple environments. In this tutorial, we'll use Resteasy to create a simple RESTful Web application and a client to invoke it.
